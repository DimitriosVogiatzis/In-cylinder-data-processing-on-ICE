## Script Description
This script receives raw experimental data of pressure signal from an in-cylinder pressure sensor on a 2-stroke engine and finds misfire events.
According to the user-selected pressure limit "Pres_limit" for not-combustible expansion phase (while at downward movement of the piston), every crank-cycle without combustion is identified.

Then, the motivo of consecutive combustions before each and every misfire is identified and presented in a normalized histogram. 
Finally the average number of consecutive combustions and it's standart deviation are calculated.

## How to use
1. Load your pressure signal data to a matlab stuck at the same folder or use the default.
2. Open the Pattern_misfire.m and set your pressure limit or use the default.
3. Run the Pattern_misfire.m
4. PLotting
